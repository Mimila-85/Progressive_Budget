## Usage

This is a budget track app where the user is presented with inputs to enter the name of a transaction, and the value for this transaction. Then the user has the option to add or subtract it from the budget. The transaction list is updated accordingly, as well as the total available value. The user can continue to enter transactions even when he/she does not have internet. The database will be updated once the user is back online.
